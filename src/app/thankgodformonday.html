"<div>Thank God for Monday <br> This weekend's been getting long <br> Too much time for thinking and <br> 
There's work to be done <br> But thank God for Friday <br> When I'm tired of this shit <br> Selling things that don't matter <br> To a new generation of kids <br> <br> Some days I think I'm important <br> Cause my job has a fancy name <br> Cause I went to a name-brand school <br> And was told: I'm-above-average-for-my-age <br> <br> I'm sorry when I'm like that <br> It doesn't mean a thing <br> But when that's your version of winning <br> You learn to cling <br> <br> So thank God for your patience <br> As I pace around the house <br> On your one day off <br><br> This is how I've always been <br> And probably how I'll be <br> So I'm learning to be present <br> Despite my big, big dreams <br> Some days I'm distant <br> It doesn't mean nothing <br> And I know it messes with your head <br> <br> I'm sorry when I'm like that <br> I know it hurts us both <br> But there are so many things <br> I'm not ready to let go <br><br> So thank God for grace <br> The ability to be sincere <br> And know my depth <br> Is a disguise for my fear <br><br> </div>"
